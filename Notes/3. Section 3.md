## 030 Node, V8, Libuv and C++
## 031 Processed, Threads and the Thread Pool
### Node Process and Threads
THREAD POOL:
* Additional 4 threads(or more)
* offload work from the event loop
* Handle heavy("expensive") tasks:
  * File system APIs
  * Cryprography
  * Compression
  * DNS lookups
  * ...

## 032 The Node.js Event Loop
### Four phases in the event loop
1. Expired timer callbacks
2. I/O polling and callbacks
3. setlmmediate callbacks
4. Close callbacks
### other
* Process.Nexttick() QUEUE
* Other MicroTasks QUEUE(Resolved promise)
